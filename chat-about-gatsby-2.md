Hey Cristian -- this is Sam from Gatsby. Sorry for this random PR -- I couldn't find your email through searching and figured this would be the best way to reach you.

It looks like you're building something with Wordpress as a CMS and Gatsby as a frontend / build system?

Kyle and I are really interested in publishing people's experiences doing this -- would you be interested in writing a blog post for gatsbyjs.org?

You can reply to me at sam@gatsbyjs.com
